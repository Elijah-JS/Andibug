# Andibug <3

**Andibug** is an engaging jumping game where players navigate through increasingly challenging platforms. As you ascend higher, the difficulty ramps up, making for an exciting gaming experience. The game keeps track of your score and allows you to compete for high scores.

## Features

- Simple and intuitive controls
- Randomly generated platforms that move as you progress
- Dynamic background images for an immersive experience
- Score tracking with high score storage
- Game over screen with the option to restart

## Installation

To run Andibug, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed on your machine. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install Pygame**: Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   pip install pygame
   ```

3. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

4. **Download Assets**: Ensure all image assets (like `Andibug 1.png`, background images, and platform images) are in the same directory as the game file.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Run the Python script containing the game code.
2. **Controls**:
   - Use the `A` key to move left.
   - Use the `D` key to move right.
   - Press the `Space` key to restart after a game over.
3. **Objective**: Jump from platform to platform, avoiding falling off the screen. The goal is to reach the highest score possible by staying on the platforms and navigating upward.

4. **Scoring**: Your score increases as you ascend. The game records your highest score, which can be viewed in the score panel at the top of the screen.

## Game Over

If you fall off the screen, the game will enter a "game over" state. You can press the `Space` key to restart the game and try to beat your previous score.
